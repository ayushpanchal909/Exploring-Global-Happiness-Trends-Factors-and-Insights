## World-Happiness-Index-Analysis
In my project, I collected data on world happiness from Wikipedia and through web scraping. After gathering the data, I cleaned it by dealing with duplicated and empty values. I organized the information into a table, establishing relationships between countries, years, and various factors in the dataset. This allowed me to uncover insights like the Top 10 Happiest Countries, Bottom 10 Happiest Countries, and the correlation between different factors and happiness scores each year. I also identified countries with significant jumps in index rank from 2017 to 2020, examined the distribution of happiness scores, and conducted a regional analysis based on averages.

To visualize the data, I created interactive line charts showcasing the happiness scores of select countries over the years. Additionally, I generated box plots to illustrate how happiness scores varied each year. Through bar charts, I highlighted the countries that experienced the most substantial increases in their happiness scores. In summary, my project involved collecting, cleaning, and analyzing world happiness data to uncover trends and patterns, which I then presented using various visualizations to make the information easily understandable.
